Profiling means providing other than the conventional planar bonding surface to define cavities therein. The bonding material fills the cavities in the microstructures. For instance, a system of ridges and trenches (e.g. in cross-section vertical, slanted, key-holed shaped, or diamond-shaped) are microstructures that increase the surface area of the wafers to which the bonding material can adhere. Use of the key-hole shaped or diamond-shaped profile having a negative slope at the trench interior substantially increases the bonding force. Where electrical leads feed through a bond, the seal to the bond at that point is improved by either using lengthened feedthroughs which extend the length of a substantial portion of the bond or by use of doped (diffused) conductive wafer regions rather than metallized feedthroughs. In some cases the bonded surfaces include spacers which define a precisely defined distance between the two wafers, thus providing an exactly specified thickness of the bonding material. In some cases the edges of the bonded assembly are sealed by a sealant which extends through narrow capillary spaces between the two bonded wafers, thus hermetically sealing together the two wafers.","[122, 287, 1861, 334, 541]","[0.5664518475532532, 0.5581331849098206, 0.5553571581840515, 0.5484330654144287, 0.5461456775665283]","[10, 137, 134, 19, 136]",10,"[0.49324545, 0.5437021, 0.52465445, 0.45966628, 0.51686203]",0.49324545,0.5437021,0.52465445,0.45966628,0.51686203,0.50762606,0.0010459234,0.03234074,0.45966628,0.5437021,0.5664518475532532,0.5581331849098206,0.5553571581840515,0.5484330654144287,0.5461456775665283,0.5549041867256165,6.564174417995616e-05,0.0081019592803195

Immersing the wafer in a plating fluid bath reduces the occurrence of trapped gas pockets within via holes which makes it easier to plate them. The continuous directing of plating fluid towards the surface of the wafer increases the ion concentration gradient which is, in turn, increases the plating rate.

We have discovered a method of etching tungsten or tungsten nitride which permits precise etch profile control while providing excellent selectivity, of at least 175:1, for example, in favor of etching tungsten or tungsten nitride rather than an adjacent oxide layer. Typically the oxide is selected from silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, tantalum oxide, zirconium oxide, and combinations thereof. The method appears to be applicable to tungsten or tungsten nitride, whether deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD) of chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In particular, an initial etch chemistry, used during the majority of the tungsten or tungsten nitride etching process (the main etch), employs the use of a plasma source gas where the chemically functional etchant species are generated from a combination of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen (N2), or in the alternative, from a combination of nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), chlorine (Cl2) and carbon tetrafluoride (CF4). Toward the end of the main etching process, a second chemistry is used in which the chemically functional etchant species are generated from Cl2 and O2. This final portion of the etch process may be referred to as an &#8220;overetch&#8221; process, since etching is carried out to at least the surface underlying the tungsten or tungsten nitride. However, this second etch chemistry may optionally be divided into two steps, where the plasma source gas oxygen content and plasma source power are increased in the second step.","[37, 367, 400, 329, 565]","[0.7254863977432251, 0.6995090842247009, 0.607006847858429, 0.5945836901664734, 0.5865309238433838]","[10, 10, 10, 1, 10]",10,"[0.60158235, 0.60158235, 0.60158235, 0.42273176, 0.60158235]",0.60158235,0.60158235,0.60158235,0.42273176,0.60158235,0.56581223,0.0063975067,0.07998441,0.42273176,0.60158235,0.7254863977432251,0.6995090842247009,0.607006847858429,0.5945836901664734,0.5865309238433838,0.6426233887672425,0.0042062439633571,0.0648555623162515

According to one embodiment of the invention, antimicrobial compound containing liposomes are added to water systems prone to biofouling and biofilm formation. The liposomes, being similar in composition to microbial membranes or cells, are readily incorporated into the existing biofilm. Once the antimicrobial compound containing liposomes become entrained with the biofilm matrix, the decomposition or programmed disintegration of the liposome proceeds. Thereafter, the biocidal aqueous core is released to react directly with the biofilm encased microorganisms. Upon the death of the organisms, the polysaccharide/protein matrix decomposes and thereby results in reduced fouling of the water bearing system, resulting in increased heat transfer, increased flux, less deposit of colloidal and particulate solids and dissolved organics on the surface of the microfiltration membrane, thereby reducing the frequency and duration of the membrane cleaning and ultimate replacement.","[692, 1972, 250, 1404, 610]","[0.7110370397567749, 0.6943165063858032, 0.6201984882354736, 0.5694491863250732, 0.5643825531005859]","[2, 66, 66, 2, 2]",2,"[0.5552572, 0.58027875, 0.58027875, 0.5552572, 0.5552572]",0.5552572,0.58027875,0.58027875,0.5552572,0.5552572,0.56526583,0.00018782343,0.013704869,0.5552572,0.58027875,0.7110370397567749,0.6943165063858032,0.6201984882354736,0.5694491863250732,0.5643825531005859,0.6318767547607422,0.0046885309428049,0.0684728482159527
